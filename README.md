This is a machine learning library developed by Matthew Christensen for CS5350/6350 in University of Utah



NOTES:

When running the script for hw2, the machine will take an EXTREMELY long time to compute results. I have reduced the number of calculations that need to be made by a factor of 10 for each of the sections, but all in all, this code should take a long long long time.
